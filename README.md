In April 2020 the BBC England Data Unit and the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52369758) on pubs and restaurants turning to crowdfunding websites to survive the coronavirus lockdown.

The BBC found at least 15 active appeals on the website Crowdfunder.co.uk raising funds for pubs, restaurants and music venues to help them through the lockdown, though there are likely to be dozens more.

Some are using other sites such as GoFundMe, or are launching donation schemes locally.

The word "covid" appeared more than any other in a sample of 1,000 titles of appeals hosted on the Crowdfunder website.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
