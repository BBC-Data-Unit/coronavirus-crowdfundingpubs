In April 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52369758) on pubs and restaurants turning to crowdfunding websites to survive the coronavirus lockdown.

The BBC found at least 15 active appeals on the website Crowdfunder.co.uk raising funds for pubs, restaurants and music venues to help them through the lockdown, though there are likely to be dozens more.

Some are using other sites such as GoFundMe, or are launching donation schemes locally.

The word "covid" appeared more than any other in a sample of 1,000 titles of appeals hosted on the Crowdfunder website.
