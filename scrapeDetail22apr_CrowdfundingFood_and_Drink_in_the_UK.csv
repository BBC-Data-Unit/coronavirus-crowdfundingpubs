We hit our £4000 target in only 5 days.,A massive thank-you to everyone who has supported and backed our project so far. It has been an amazing response and we really appreciate what has happened here. We can now say with a strong voice that the blue horsebox will be transformed into a kitchen.,"However...we still have 21 days to go and have therefore decided to raise our target, so that, we can fund some other essential things we need to get us back out onto the road in tip top shape.",If we can raise another £1000 we can get secure storage for the horsebox so the vandals cannot get anywhere near it. This costs £65 month so will give us approx 12 months secure storage.,An extra £2000 above target will enable me to take trailer driving lessons and the licence test. (approx £800- if i pass first time!),"If we raise another £4000, our final target. I can put money into a reliable towing vehicle which will get me where i am supposed to be! And I can take on staff. I will be able to recruit and train staff and be able to put the systems in place to become an employer, payroll etc. My final aim is to create an opportunity for someone to join Manjit's Kitchen.",Thank you for reading - I look forward to serving you food from the horsebox.,MANJIT'S KITCHEN - Horsebox to Kitchen Project,Hello - I'm Manjit Kaur and I am the owner and operator of the indian Street Food business Manjit's Kitchen.

All being well, the money from the insurance will cover the cost of a towing vehicle;but Manjit’s Kitchen will need support from all sorts of skilled people in order to convert the horsebox into a working kitchen. The sooner it all happens, the sooner I can get my show back where I want to be – on the road. I calculate the cost of conversion to be £4000",Design and cutting of the horsebox: £1500,"Equipment (Cooker, Sink etc) & Installation","£1,000 ",Electrical work: £500,Branding & painting: £1000.,"I am also seeking investment in terms skills, time, advice, information which will be just as valuable as i go about building Manjit’s Kitchen again.
